    	<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    	<p>An interactive website for improving lives within a click and making lives easier!
On this website, people can order medicine online, sitting at home.The basic idea is to provide an online platform that facilitates online transaction
of medicines and a trustworthy source of medical information. The website 
contains medicine names with pictures. The required medicines when selected
will be added to a cart, and the total cost will be calculated. When the user
checks out his credit card information will be asked, or it can be cash on
delivery.
Again, if someone is not sure which medicine to choose for their specific
disease, then he/she can search for their required medicines as per the
symptoms in the Health Information Guide.</p>
